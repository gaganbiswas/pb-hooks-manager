# 🗂️ PocketBase Hooks Manager

Simple and minimalist hooks manager for your pocketbase server.
Compatible version: `v0.22.x` (In theory should work with lower versions as well)

_Note: For a similar hooks manager that is compatible with version `>=0.23.x` refer to https://github.com/deselected/pb-hooks-dash_

## Thanks

This project builds on the excellent work from https://github.com/deselected/pb-hooks-dash. While not a traditional fork, it uses the original repository as its base.

Big shout-out to the author for such a great project — hoping to see more updates soon!
